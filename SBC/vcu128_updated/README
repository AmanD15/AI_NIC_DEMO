NIC_1.2 on VCU128

constraints/ - xdc file which contains the constraints for vcu128 board
docs/ - Folder contains figures for explanation of the architecture
hsys/ - source files for SBC_original subsystem
hsys_1.1/ - source files for SBC_fastmem subsystem
testing/ - Files for RTT and Throughput test by sending packets and images
toplevel/ - Contains SBC core(hand edited **not_used**) and toplevel vhdl file inside respective folders
vhdl/ - VHDL files related to ai_ml engine should be copied here
vivado_synth/ - Script to generate bitstream files


Building Hardware
-----------------------
    - Enter hsys folder and run build.sh script 
      - This will generate required VHDL files for each subsystem

    - If there are any changes that need to be done in either
        SBC core or toplevel SBC, make those changes in the files 
        present in toplevel folder
    
    - Enter vivado_synth folder and run run.sh script
      - This should generate two files, processor_1x1x32.sbc.vcu128.bit and processor_1x1x32.sbc.vcu128.ltx


loading the bit-file  and running an example
----------------------------------------------

	Follow the instructions in testing/testingNIC_1.2/README
