    1. ./build.sh
    2. cd cortos_build/cortos_src
    3. changes to be made in vmap.txt:  
        non cacheable lock page should be mapped to 0x50000000
    4. changes to be made in init.s
        initialize non cacheable lock from 0x50000000
			to first illegal address 0x50001000

    (see files inside temp. for reference)
    5. cd .. (now you are inside cortos_build)
    6. ./build.sh
	
1. Overview
-------------------------

	This document describes
	- the example used to measure packet ping speed/round trip time
	  between the vcu128 card and the host computer via Ethernet.
	- the setup of the host computer (to enable the connection 
	  for the test)
	- the application running on the host computer.
	- the setup of the vcu128 card
		
2. The example
-------------------------

    During this test, raw Ethernet frames are transmitted from the host-side driver 
    code (running on a PC/laptop) to the VCU128 card.  The SBC on the VCU128 card, 
    with the help of NIC subsystem, receives these frames and sends them back to 
    the host side. 

3. VCU128 setup 
-------------------------------

  1) Hardware Setup
    i) Load the bitfile generated in the vivado_synth folder to the VCU128 board
        using UART
    
    ii) First press the cpu reset button on board (Refer to CPU_RESET, SW4 push button, 
        in the VCU128 user guide present in docs folder)

    iii) In the Vivado UI, go to VIO tab and reset the RESET_TO_NIC and RESET_TO_PROCESSOR
        signals
    
  2) Software Setup
    i) Run the ./build.sh script using ajit toochain to generate cortos files

    ii) Run ajit debug monitor and run the command "s run.script"
        - command for debug monitor is "ajit_debug_monitor_mt -u <tty-dev>"
        - To learn more about debug monitor, visit https://github.com/adhuliya/ajit-toolchain/blob/marshal/AjitPublicResources/tools/		ajit_debug_monitor_mt/docs/ajit_debug_monitor_mt.txt

    iii) Once the program is dumped in the FPGA, go to host folder and run different tests.

    Note: You can also view cortos_printf statements from the program using serial monitor
        of your preferred choice(Just set the baud rate at 115200).  
    

4. Host setup and application
-------------------------------

    Driver Application: 
    Launch only after configuring Ethernet link as per Step 3 and after
    setting Wireshark to filter packets for the specified interface.

    Promiscuous Mode Settings: 
    Enable promiscuous mode for Wireshark.

    Host Configuration: 
    On Ubuntu 16.04/20.04, modify wired settings for the ethernet connection:
        - Details Section: Uncheck "Connect automatically", check "Make available to other users".
        - Security Section: Disable 802.1x security.
        - IPv4/IPv6 Section: Disable both protocols.
          NOTE: If above settings, don't work one can simply click "disconnect" ethernet 
                connection settings. 

    Application Execution: 
        sudo python3 send.py
