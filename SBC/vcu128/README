AI ML Accelerator on VCU128

constraints/ - xdc file which contains the constraints for vcu128 board
docs/ - Folder contains figures for explanation of the architecture
hsys/ - source files for subsystems
testing/ - Files for testing LeNet architecture
toplevel/ - Contains SBC core(hand edited) and toplevel vhdl file
vhdl/ - VHDL files related to ai_ml engine should be copied here
vivado_synth/ - Script to generate bitstream files


Building Hardware
    - Enter hsys folder and run build.sh script 
      - This will generate required VHDL files for each subsystem

    - If there are any changes that need to be done in either
        SBC core or toplevel SBC, make those changes in the files 
        present in toplevel folder
    
    - Enter vivado_synth folder and run run.sh script
      - This should generate two files, processor_1x1x32.sbc.vcu128.bit and processor_1x1x32.sbc.vcu128.ltx
