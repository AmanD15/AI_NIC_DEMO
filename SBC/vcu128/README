constraints/ - xdc file which contains the constraints for vcu128 board
docs/ - Folder contains figures for explanation of the architecture
hsys/ - source files for subsystems
testing/ - Files for testing memory march, NIC march and Accelerator
toplevel/ - Contains SBC core(hand edited) and toplevel vhdl file
vivado_synth/ - Script to generate bitstream files


TODO
-------------------------------
    - Memory March Test - DONE
    - NIC March Test - DONE
    - Ethernet Test - Done 
        - Ping Test and Send + Receive of Weights & Input modules
    - Accelerator Test - Pending
        - Processor is in run state and did not go to halt mode
        - Struck in while loop of testing/accl_demo/main.c
        - Reason: Register 0 of accelerators is not updated from 0x00111 to 0x11111
        - Register 0 is returning 0x00011
        - Data in other registers is correct
        - [accelerator_worker_daemon] in accelerator_processor_interface.aa
           3rd bit is assigned 0 -> then calls convolutionAll() function -> then sets register 0 to 0x11111
        - Need to read convolutionAll() function
        - Same error in bitfile of Integration folder but it is working correctly in Networking folder
