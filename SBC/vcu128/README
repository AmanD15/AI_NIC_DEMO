AI ML Accelerator on VCU128

1. Overview
-------------------------

	This document describes
	- the example used to measure packet ping speed/round trip time
	  between the kc705 card and the host computer via Ethernet.
	- the setup of the host computer (to enable the connection 
	  for the test)
	- the application running on the host computer.
	- the setup of the KC705 card
		
  
1. Observations
-------------------------------
    - Wireshark displays double the number of sent packets on the ethernet interface with 
      source and destination MAC addresses, swapped.
    - RTT time can be observed in Wireshark.
    - for 10 Mbps  link avg RTT : 0.3ms
    - for 100 Mbps link avg RTT : 0.1ms


6. TODO
-------------------------------
    - Understand the top level design of the Aman's Accelerator code
    - Modify the current code to include the Amans Accelerator code
    - Modify the constraints file
    - Modify the bitstream generation script and successfully generate the bitstream
    - Complete the march test and accelerator test
