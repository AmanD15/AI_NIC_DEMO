	The Ethernet check test

			Authors: Siddhant Singh Tomar and Indrahas Reddy.

1. Overview
-------------------------

	This document describes
	- the example used to confirm correct Ethernet Rx/Tx
	  between the kc705 card and the host computer.
	- the setup of the host computer (to enable the connection 
	  for the test)
	- the application running on the host computer.
	- the setup of the KC705 card
		
2. The example
-------------------------

    During this test, raw Ethernet frames are transmitted from the host-side driver 
    code (running on a PC/laptop) to the KC705 card.  The SBC on the KC705 card, 
    with the help of NIC subsystem, receives these frames and sends them back to 
    the host side without any modifications. 

    To monitor the packets received at the host side, the Wireshark packet-sniffer
    is used.   Some information is also extracted from the NIC.

3. KC705 setup 
-------------------------------
    Configuration: 
    Apply SBC bitfile to KC705 card, then dump main.remapped via Debug monitor.

    Ethernet Link Activation: 
    Check active status via LEDs near ethernet port. Configure speed (10/100/1000) 
    using SW11 GPIO DIP switches. Update speed by pressing SW5 center push button.

    SW11 DIP switch : 1 2 3 4
                      0 0 0 0 --> 10Mbps
                      1 0 0 0 --> 100Mbps
                      0 1 0 0 --> 1000Mbps
    


4. Host setup and application
-------------------------------

    Driver Application: 
    Launch only after configuring Ethernet link as per Step 3 and after
    setting Wireshark to filter packets for the specified interface.
    
    Promiscuous Mode Settings: 
    Enable promiscuous mode for the Ethernet interface (enp2s0) and Wireshark to 
    capture packets despite incorrect destination MAC addresses.
        - set Ethernet interface to promiscuous mode : sudo ifconfig enp2s0 promisc
        - set Wireshark setup to promiscuous mode : Refer to the official website.

    Host Configuration: 
    On Ubuntu 16.04/20.04, modify wired settings for the ethernet connection:
        - Details Section: Uncheck "Connect automatically", check "Make available to other users".
        - Security Section: Disable 802.1x security.
        - IPv4/IPv6 Section: Disable both protocols.
          NOTE: If above settings, don't work one can simply click "disconnect" ethernet 
                connection settings. 


    Application Execution: 
    Run "run.sh" and provide the ethernet interface name as the first argument (e.g., "enp2s0"). 
    Two modes to send frames:
        - 1. Send fixed-sized frames, e.g., ./run.sh 1 64 (mode, number of packets)
        - 2. Send frames of increasing size, e.g., ./run.sh 2 64 (mode, number of packets)

  
5. Observations
-------------------------------
    Wireshark displays double the number of sent packets on the ethernet interface with 
    identical source and destination MAC addresses.


6. TODO
-------------------------------
    - Investigate processor sometimes jumps to error state during testing.
    - Refine README content.
    - Cleanup driver code and SBC side code.
