		The Ethernet check test

			Authors

1. Overview
-------------------------

	This document describes
		- the example used to confirm correct Ethernet Rx/Tx
	 	  between the kc705 card and the host computer.
		- the setup of the host computer (to enable the connection 
			for the test)
		- the application running on the host computer.
		- the setup of the KC705 card
		
2. The example
-------------------------

    During this test, raw Ethernet frames are transmitted from the host-side driver 
    code (running on a PC/laptop) to the KC705 card.  The SBC on the KC705 card, 
    with the help of NIC subsystem, receives these frames and sends them back to 
    the host side without any modifications. 

    To monitor the packets received at the host side, the Wireshark packet-sniffer
    is used.   Some information is also extracted from the NIC.

    STEPS:
    
    1. Host side (PC/laptop).
        This step has two substeps, one is configuring wired connection setting and second is running the driver code.

        A)Configuring wired connection settings.

            One needs to ensure the host side is properly set up to send raw ethernet frames and is not sending extra/unwanted packets e.g ARP packets etc.
            To do this go to wired settings and ensure the following settings for your ethernet connection.
                -In the Details section  : Untick checkboxes "Connect automatically", tick "Make available to other users".
                -In the Security section : Disable 802.1x security
                -In the IPv4 and IPv6 section: Disable IPv4 and IPv6.
            Only after ensuring above, run the driver code.

        B)Running the driver code.
            

        



    2. Hardware side (SBC on FPGA).
