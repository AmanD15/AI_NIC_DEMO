This README guides you through the process of testing the Ethernet interface on the KC705 FPGA board.

    TEST SUMMARY:

    On the FPGA card, SBC (1x1x32 AJIT Processor with NIC subsystem) is configured.
    During this test, raw Ethernet frames are transmitted from the host-side driver code (running on a PC/laptop) to the KC705 card. 
    The AJIT Processor, with the help of NIC subsystem, receives these frames and sends them back to the host side without any modifications. 
    To monitor the packets received at the host side, Wireshark is used.


    STEPS:
    
    1. Host side (PC/laptop).
        This step has two substeps, one is configuring wired connection setting and second is running the driver code.

        A)Configuring wired connection settings.

            One needs to ensure the host side is properly set up to send raw ethernet frames and is not sending extra/unwanted packets e.g ARP packets etc.
            To do this go to wired settings and ensure the following settings for your ethernet connection.
                -In the Details section  : Untick checkboxes "Connect automatically", tick "Make available to other users".
                -In the Security section : Disable 802.1x security
                -In the IPv4 and IPv6 section: Disable IPv4 and IPv6.
            Only after ensuring above, run the driver code.

        B)Running the driver code.
