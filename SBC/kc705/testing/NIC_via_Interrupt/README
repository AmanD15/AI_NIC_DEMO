	The NIC Emulation via interrupts for Software testing.

			Authors: Siddhant Singh Tomar.

 Overview:
-------------------------

	This document emulates the NIC behavior via interrupts to test 
        the software for packet Rx and Tx, running on AJIT.

	interrupt_handler() : Emulates the NIC behaviour.

				            Transmission:
				                  - pops a pointer to buffer from TransmitQ.
                                  - pushes the pointer to FreeQ.

				            Reception:
				                  - pops a pointer to a free buffer from freeQ.
				                  - constructs/stores a packet in the free buffer. 
				                  - pushes the pointer to the buffer to ReceiveQ. 	
			     
	main()              : Software under test.	

				      - pops a pointer to a buffer from ReceiveQ.  
				      - pushes the pointer to the buffer to TransmitQ.
