To build the hsys files, follow these steps:

1. Open Docker with the Ahir toolchain.
2. Run `./build.sh` to generate the system files.
3. Run `./clean.sh` to clean the generated files.

If you encounter issues with `./build.sh`, ensure that the PATH variable includes the path `/ahir/release/scripts`. 
You can check this by running `echo $PATH`. If the path is not included, add it using the following command:
`export PATH=$PATH:/ahir/release/scripts`
