Overview:
This directory contains everything needed to generate 
the bitfiles and software for testing.

Directory Structure:

- docs:
  Contains diagrams for various subsystems used 
  in the SBCs and the final toplevel diagram.

- hsys files:
  Generate the VHDL files based on the type of SBC you want to use:
  - hsys: original_SBC 
  - hsys_1.1: SBC_FASTMEM 
  - hsys_1.2: SBC_L2CACHE 

    the main difference between the above three configuration 
    is in the ACB_AFB_complex subsystem. For reference one can 
    take a look at digarams at: 
    ./<hsys>or<hsys_1.1>or<hsys_1.2>/acb_afb_complex

- organizedMAC:
  Example design of trimode Ethernet MAC IP adapted for use with the custom NIC.

- vivado_synth:
  Contains the TCL script "bitgen.tcl" for generating the bit file. Edit the script 
  to include the appropriate files for hsys, hsys_1.1, or hsys_1.2.
  ./vivado_synth/bitfiles/tested contains the tested bitfile for all three config.

- ip_consolidated:
  Contains other Xilinx IPs used in the project.

- constraints:
  Contains the Xilinx constraint file (.xdc).

- testing:
  Contains code needed for testing the bitfiles.
  - latestNICtesting: Code for testing NIC in Networking/NIC with drivers in Networking/NIC/driver.
  - testingNIC_1.1: Code for testing NIC_1.1 in Networking/NIC_1.1 with drivers in Networking/NIC_1.1/driver.
  - NIC_via_interrupt: NIC emulated via interrupt.
  - march test: March test to check NIC register and memory.
