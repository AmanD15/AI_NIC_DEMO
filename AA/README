To generate VHDL:

    Assume that the AHIR infra-structure is available
    as a docker image on your system.

    Run
	 sh ./docker_command.sh
	(Assumption: AHIR docker image)

In Docker container:
   Run the following commands
 	cd home
 	make

   Now, you can exit docker

If AHIR is locally installed, just source the
AHIR/release/ahir_bashrc and type 
	make



The following files will be created:
	ai_ml_engine_global_package.vhdl
	ai_ml_engine.vhdl
	ethernet_boot_global_package.vhdl
	ethernet_boot.vhdl
	nic_system_global_package.vhdl
	nic_system.vhdl
