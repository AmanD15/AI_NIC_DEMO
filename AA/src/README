Source code for AI-ML Accelerator, NIC and Ethernet booting sequence.
It contains the following:

ConvAll - Source code for AI-ML engine design

NIC - Source code for NIC and Ethernet boot

acc_proc_test - Contains peripheral functions for connecting acceletor to the processor 

accelerator_processor_interface.aa - AA code for the register-based interface between accelerator and processor
decl.aa - AA code for global declarations for convolution engine. Also has the memory definition 
readWriteModules.aa - Maps the read write signals from modules to the memory module. Deadlock prevention mechanism is also implemented here
timer.aa - Code for timer module (currently commented in Makefile)

lib, vhdl, build.sh - Code and utilities to generate dualPort memories
