Source code for the engine. Contains the following files:

prog.aa - Top level (convolutionAll) and associated multiplier/divider modue

decl.aa - Comtains the parameter and pipe declarations used throughout the design

input*.aa - Set of input modules that read the input and send to the convolution core

kernel*.aa - Kernel modules performing DMA and supplying data to the core

send*.aa - Output modules, read data from accumulator, and write back to memory 

convCore.aa - Definition of the core module and the accumulator. Uses repeated macro definitions to generate the processing elements. The core module contains most control signals as they are common to all processing elements
convInner.aa - Code for single core (48 processing elements). Contains definition of per-core control signals
macro_files*.aa - Files instantiated using macro definition inside convCore and convInner to generate parallelism

scaler.aa - Code implementing the scaling functionality 

conv_macro.aa - File to collect all the source files and preprocess them into a single file

conv_compiled.aa - Compilation of all source files in this directory. Do not edit as this is a script-generated file and will get overwritten
