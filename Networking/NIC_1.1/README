1.  How to test

	Go to testbench/ and type "build.sh".
	Environment variable AHIR_RELEASE must be defined.
	
	attach two terminals to docker conatainer
		first : in one terminal run "./tb/bin/tb 4"
		second: in other terminal run "./ghdl/test_system_test_bench
	

2. Correctness

	To make sure FREEQUEUE is working right, we send 4 packets. 
	Each queue can hold 4 messages, so we put 4 buffers into FREEQUEUE. 
	The receive engine uses these buffers, then passes them to TXQUEUE. 
	The transmit engine moves the buffers back to FREEQUEUE. 
	Finally, we check if the buffers in FREEQUEUE arrived in the 
	same order they were sent.
		

3.  How to build

	Go to build_nic_only/ and type "make".
	Environment variable AHIR_RELEASE must be defined.
