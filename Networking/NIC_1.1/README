	Organization of the NIC_2.0 related work
	--------------------------------------

what's new?
	
	Contains the NIC, with a new free queue for transmit engine
	its called "FREEQUEUE_TX", in the implementation.

1.  How to test

	Go to testbench/ and type "build.sh".
	Environment variable AHIR_RELEASE must be defined.
	
	attach two terminals to docker conatainer
		first : in one terminal run "./tb/bin/tb 4"
		second: in other terminal run "./ghdl/test_system_test_bench
	

2. Correctness

	To make sure FREEQUEUE_TX is working right, we send 4 packets. 
	Each queue can hold 4 messages, so we put 4 buffers into FREEQUEUE. 
	The receive engine uses these buffers, then passes them to TXQUEUE. 
	The transmit engine moves the buffers to FREEQUEUE_TX. 
	Finally, we check if the buffers in FREEQUEUE_TX arrived in the 
	same order they were sent.
		

3.  How to build

	Go to build_nic_only/ and type "make".
	Environment variable AHIR_RELEASE must be defined.
