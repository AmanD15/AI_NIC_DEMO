	A test setup for the verification of the NIC
		M.P. Desai

------------------------------------------------------------
1. Overview
------------------------------------------------------------

	The test setup consists of a test-system and
	a test-bench

------------------------------------------------------------
2. Test-system
------------------------------------------------------------

	The test-system consists of 
		- the NIC
			a complete model of a single
			NIC.

		- the NIC_MAC_BRIDGE
			MAC <-> NIC concatenation and
			deconcatenation functionality.

		- the TESTER
			A conversion layer between the
			test-system and the software test
			bench (ie the PROCESSOR)

			NIC <-> PROCESSOR slave interface
			bridging

			NIC <-> RAM master interface 
			bridging.

			NIC <-> MAC bridging 

		- the ACB-MUX
			Mux the two masters (NIC and PROCESSOR)
			onto a single bus.  Lock-aware.

------------------------------------------------------------
3. Test-bench
------------------------------------------------------------
	
		Implements the following flow

			- initialize the FREE, RX, TX queues in memory.
			- set the physical addresses related to the
				queue (the queue-base, bget, lock addresses).
				in the NIC registers.
			- start transmit and receive daemons.

		The test-bench contains a processor-side implementation
		of the pop and push functions for the FREE, RX, TX queues.
		These are exactly in synch with the NIC implementation,
		except that 32-bit virtual addresses are used in the 
		testbench.

------------------------------------------------------------
4. What has been tested?
------------------------------------------------------------

		Up to 16 packets, with free/rx/tx queues of 
		depth 4 have been checked.

5. Diagram
------------------------------------------------------------
	A block diagram showing the testbench
	threads and their interaction with
	the NIC being verified is included in this
	directory.
