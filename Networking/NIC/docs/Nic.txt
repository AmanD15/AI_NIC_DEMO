	Design and verification of the NIC
		Harshad Ugale


1. Overview
-------------

	The NIC is intended to be a bridge between
	the Ethernet MAC and the AJIT/Processing subsystem.


2. Interfaces
--------------
	- MAC side
	- Processor side
		- control interface (AFB, slave)
		- data interface (ACB, master)

3. Behaviour
-------------

	- interface buffers in shared memory between
		NIC and processor.

	- buffer management

		Free buffer queue

		Nic->Processor queues
		Processor->Nic queues
		
		control/registers
			- addresses of the buffer queues
				(for each nic, there is a per-processor-thread
					tx-queue and rx-queue)

	- for MAC -> Processor path
		Nic gets free buffer from free queue
		Nic collects packet into buffer 
		Nic writes buffer id into -> Processor-thread queue


	- for Processor -> MAC path
		Nic polls queues from processor-threads
		... to be filled in  ....
