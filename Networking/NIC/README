	Organization of the NIC related work
	--------------------------------------


1. Overview
	
	Contains the NIC implementation in Aa (in src/),
	a testbench in C (in testbench/), a build/ directory
	and documentation (docs/)

1.  How to build and test

	Go to build/ and type make.
	Environment variable AHIR_RELEASE must be defined.


2.  Test algorithm

	A mac-to-nic thread generates packets for the NIC.
	The packets carry data whose values form an arithmetic
	progression.

	The CPU first initializes and then enables the NIC.

	The NIC handles the incoming packets and puts them
	into buffers and enqueues the buffer pointers to the
	CPU.

	The CPU reads the incoming buffer queue and transfers
	its entry to the outgoing buffer queue (no modifications	
	are made)

	The NIC polls the outgoint queue and transmits packet to
	MAC

	A nic-to-mac thread receives the transmitted packets from
	the NIC and confirms that they are OK.

3. Correctness

	Packets must be received in the same sequence they were
	sent (arithmetic progression is checked).  This is checked
	in the nic-to-mac thread.


4. Builds
	build/
		nic + testbench

	build_nic_only/
		core nic only.

	src/ contains the AA code.
