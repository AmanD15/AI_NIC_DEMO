Title: Building and Using Single Board Computer (SBC)

For building the hardware (bitfiles), please refer to `./SBC/kc705/README`.

For building the software, which uses lwIP, please refer to `./lwip/README`. 

Host (PC) Side Setup:
- Check the connection details of "ETH_NIC_TESTING" on the machine at 10.107.90.64.

Hardware (FPGA) Setup:
After loading any SBC bitfile onto the FPGA, follow these steps:
1. Press the east push button to reset the clock.
2. Reset the processor using VIO by giving a reset pulse (0->1->0).
3. Reset the NIC using VIO by giving a reset pulse (0->1->0).
4. Now, you are ready to push the code using `ajit_debug_monitor_mt`.
