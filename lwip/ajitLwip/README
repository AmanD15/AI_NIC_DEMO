1. About
-----------------
   An implementation of NIC+PROCESSOR system in which
   the NIC is emulated via an interrupt-service-routine.

3. Explanation
----------------------
After lwIP and the NIC are initialized, the emulated NIC code sends 
(or the NIC receives) an ICMP ping packet. In response, lwIP sends an 
ARP request packet. The emulated NIC code recognizes the ARP packet 
and sends an ARP response packet. When the emulated NIC code 
subsequently sends (or the NIC receives) another ICMP ping packet, 
lwIP responds with ICMP packets.
