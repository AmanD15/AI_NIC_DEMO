 	Directory structure explained:
 	
 	1.	This directory holds C code for Ajit and utilizes lwIP.
 		Configuration options for the lwIP stack can be found in 
 		ajitLwip/include/lwipopts.h, while low-level driver code 
 		resides in ajitLwip/src/ethernetif.c.
 	
		ajitLwip/
		
			├── src/             
			├── include/     			  
			├── main.c    

	2. 	This directory exclusively contains the original LwIP 
		TCP/IP stack by Adam Dunkels.

			├── doc/
			├── src/

		**No modifications are applied to the code maintained at 
		both https://github.com/lwip-tcpip/lwip 
		and http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/lwip.git. 
		
		Users can interchangeably utilize either the older stable 
		version or the latest updated one by directly replacing this 
		"lwip" folder.
	

		NOTE:	A. All the necessary source and header files for building 
			   the project within the lwip/src directory.
			 
 			B. ** header file "init.h" needs to be renamed to "Init.h"
 			   ** source file "init.c" needs to be renamed to "Init.c"
 			   otherwise main.elf does not build, and one can observe 
 			   "multiple definition" error in the log.
 			   
 	3.	This folder contains reference material for understanding Lwip.
