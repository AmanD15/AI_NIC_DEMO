 	Directory structure explained:
 	
 	1.	This directory holds code that utilizes lwIP.
 		for ping application and network caching application

        - ajitLwIP+NIC : for ping application
        - Caching_app  : for network content cache application
        - ajitLwip     : NIC emulation via interrupt + lwIP
               

	2. 	This directory exclusively contains the original LwIP 
		TCP/IP stack by Adam Dunkels.

		**No modifications are applied to the code maintained at 
		both https://github.com/lwip-tcpip/lwip 
		and http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/lwip.git. 
		
		Users can interchangeably utilize either the older stable 
		version or the latest updated one by directly replacing this 
		"lwip" folder.
	

		NOTE:	A. All the necessary source and header files for building 
			   the project within the lwip/src directory.
			 
 			B. ** header file "init.h" needs to be renamed to "Init.h"
 			   ** source file "init.c" needs to be renamed to "Init.c"
 			   otherwise main.elf does not build, and one can observe 
 			   "multiple definition" error in the log.
 			   
 	3.	This folder contains reference material for understanding Lwip.
