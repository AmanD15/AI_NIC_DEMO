    1. include folder
        contains various configuration file for LwIP
            - cc.h :
            - sys_arch.h:
            - lwipopts.h:
    2. src folder
            - contains mainloop code for baremetal use of LwIP.
            - ethernetif.c contanis low level drivers
            - sys_arch.c mainly contains sys_now() function
                needed for internal timers of TCP/IP stack.



Hardware (FPGA) Setup:
    After loading any SBC bitfile onto the FPGA, follow these steps:
    1. Press the east push button to reset the clock.
    2. Reset the processor using VIO by giving a reset pulse (0->1->0).
    3. Reset the NIC using VIO by giving a reset pulse (0->1->0).
    4. Now, you are ready to push the code using `ajit_debug_monitor_mt`.

Host Configuration: 
    On Ubuntu 16.04/20.04, modify wired settings for the ethernet connection:
        - Details Section: check "Connect automatically", check "Make available to other users".
        - Security Section: Disable 802.1x security.
        - IPv4 Section: Set the IP address 10.107.90.20 and netmask 255.255.240.0.
        - IPv6 Section: Disable both protocols. 
        NOTE: For reference, one can check wired settings named "ETH_NIC_TESTING"
                in the 10.107.90.64 machine in VLSI LAB

Performing the test:
    - open terminal and ping 10.107.90.23


NOTE: For original_SBC and hsys_1.2, use the regular process.
      Generating code for SBC_FASTMEM. 
    1. ./build.sh
    2. cd cortos_build/cortos_src
    3. changes to be made in vmap.txt:  
        non cacheable lock page should be mapped to 0x50000000
    4. changes to be made in init.s
        initialize non cacheable lock from 0x50000000
			to first illegal address 0x50001000

    (see files inside temp. for reference)
    5. cd .. (now you are inside cortos_build)
    6. ./build.sh
